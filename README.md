- **Database**: [Your database, e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.]  

## Purpose
This project was created to:
- Explore and apply backend development skills with Django.  
- Understand the fundamentals of search engines and result filtering.  
- Recreate and expand upon Google's functionality with my unique implementation.
